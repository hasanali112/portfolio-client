              Iâ€™m a MERN Stack developer who is passionate about creating
              error-free, user-friendly and creative web solutions. I am deeply
              passionate about continuous learning and openly sharing my
              knowledge with others. I thrive on solving real-world problems and
              always approach my work with a strategic, goal-oriented mindset,
              keeping the end objective in clear focus. My ultimate goal is to
              excel as a full-stack web developer, seamlessly managing both
              back-end and front-end development to deliver outstanding user
              experiences.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white mt-7">
              Over the past years, I have honed my expertise across various web
              development technologies, including React.js for crafting dynamic
              and high-performing user interfaces, and Next.js for enhancing
              performance and SEO through server-side rendering. My proficiency
              with Redux and RTK Query enables me to manage intricate state in
              large-scale applications, ensuring a seamless user experience.
              With TypeScript, I write reliable, type-safe code that enhances
              maintainability and reduces errors. I develop robust back-end
              services and APIs using Express, ensuring scalable server-side
              logic. Using those techonology, I created 30+ project. I take
              great pride in delivering quality work and maintaining excellent
              communication.
